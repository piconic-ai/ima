# ima

A CLI that lets you co-edit a local text file with other people, right now.
`ima <file>` prints a URL; others join from their browser.
The name comes from the Japanese 居間 (living room) and 今 (now).

## Principles
- The host's local file is the source of truth. The server never stores content.
- Updates are end-to-end encrypted with a key held in the URL fragment; the server only relays ciphertext.
- Never send the key to the server (not in requests, logs, or error reports).
- The minimal version only co-edits a single text file. No auth, comments, or AI features.

## Layout
- cmd/ima, internal/: the `ima` command (Go, single binary). internal/protocol mirrors packages/protocol on top of reearth/ygo; keep the wire format in sync
- packages/protocol: encryption, message format and room client for the web (pnpm workspace)
- packages/worker: Hono + Durable Objects (WebSocket Hibernation API). Also serves the web assets.
- packages/web: editor built on CodeMirror 6 + y-codemirror.next

## Stack
CLI: Go / ygo (pure-Go Yjs) / coder/websocket
Server and web: TypeScript / Yjs / y-protocols / Cloudflare Workers / Vitest

## Workflow
- Present a plan before implementing.
- Add tests with every change and make them pass before committing.
